### **Concurrent Banking Management System**

In this project, you'll build a simplified **banking management system** where multiple users can perform various actions concurrently, such as creating accounts, depositing/withdrawing money, checking account balance, and subscribing to account updates (notifications). You'll incorporate the concepts of **pointers**, **channels**, **mutexes**, **wait groups**, **generics**, and **interfaces** into the system.

### **Core Features/Requirements:**

1. **Account Management**:
   - Users can create accounts with unique IDs, names, and email addresses.
   - Each account has a balance that users can deposit to or withdraw from.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - Multiple users should be able to perform operations (deposit/withdraw) on the same or different accounts concurrently.
   - Use **mutexes** to avoid race conditions when updating balances.

3. **Transactions**:
   - Implement different types of transactions (e.g., Deposit, Withdrawal) using **interfaces**. Each transaction type should have a method to process the transaction.

4. **Transaction History**:
   - Each account keeps track of its transaction history, such as deposits and withdrawals.
   - Implement generics to store and retrieve a history of transactions.

5. **Notifications**:
   - Users can subscribe to receive notifications for specific account events (like deposits over a certain amount).
   - Use **channels** to notify subscribed users when their accounts hit specific thresholds.

6. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Use **goroutines** to process transactions concurrently, ensuring that deposits and withdrawals happen in parallel for multiple users.
   - Use **wait groups** to ensure all transactions are completed before calculating the final balance.

7. **System Shutdown**:
   - Implement a **done channel** that gracefully shuts down the banking system after a certain period or when all users finish their transactions.

### **Detailed Feature Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Account Structure**:
   - Each account holds:
     - `AccountID`: A unique identifier (int)
     - `Name`: Account holder's name (string)
     - `Email`: Account holder's email (string)
     - `Balance`: Current balance (float64)
     - `History`: List of transactions (generic type to store different types of transactions)
     - `mu`: **Mutex** to prevent race conditions during balance updates.

#### 2. **Account Operations**:
   - Create new accounts and initialize balance to 0.
   - Deposit/Withdraw money from an account, ensuring atomicity using **mutexes**.
   - Implement a **pointer** to the account so that any changes to the balance affect the actual account.

#### 3. **Transaction Types (Interfaces)**:
   - Define a **Transaction** interface with a method `Process()`.
   - Implement two types of transactions (`Deposit` and `Withdraw`) that implement the interface.

#### 4. **Concurrency in Transactions**:
   - Transactions should be processed concurrently using **goroutines**.
   - Use **channels** to log transaction information or notify users when a certain condition is met (e.g., balance exceeds $10,000).

#### 5. **Notification Subscriptions**:
   - Users can subscribe to account events (e.g., deposit over $1000).
   - Use **channels** to send notifications to subscribed users.

#### 6. **Transaction History (Generics)**:
   - Implement a generic structure to keep track of transaction history for each account.
   - Each account should have a transaction history that records all deposits and withdrawals.

#### 7. **Wait Group for Transaction Completion**:
   - Use **WaitGroup** to wait for all concurrent transaction operations to complete before summarizing the account balances.

#### 8. **Graceful Shutdown (Done Channel)**:
   - Implement a **done channel** to signal when the system is shutting down (e.g., after all users have finished their transactions or after a fixed time).

### **Example Scenario**:

- **User 1** opens an account and deposits $1000.
- **User 2** opens an account and subscribes to be notified when their balance exceeds $5000.
- **User 1** performs multiple transactions concurrently (deposits, withdrawals).
- **User 2** is notified via a **channel** when their account balance exceeds $5000 after a large deposit.
- After all transactions are complete, the system waits for everything to finish using a **wait group** and then gracefully shuts down with the **done channel**.
